### 2014-2016 [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org) : Remote

#### JavaScript Engine
  * Implemented sorting for typed arrays ``(new Int32Array([4, 3, .., n])).sort();``
  * Implemented sorting for arrays with custom comparators ``[4, 3, .., n].sort((x, y) => x - y);``
  * Implemented object destructuring [with default values] ``{x=1} = {}; x === 1;``
  * Rewrote parsing logic for the ``Date`` object ``new Date("5-26-1988");``
  * Added `[Learn More]` links to JavaScript error messages in the Firefox web console.
  * Added smart multi-line editing to the Firefox web console.
  * Contributed to Cretonne, a code generator for WebAssembly.

#### Release Engineering / TaskCluster
  * Part of the team building [TaskCluster](https://github.com/taskcluster), a task queuing system that powers Mozilla's next generation build pipeline.
  * Designed and built a [continuous integration system on top of TaskCluster](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-github), tailored to the needs of Mozilla's GitHub hosted repositories.
  * Created a [secret management service](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-secrets), along with a novel (http proxy based) method for injecting secrets into running CI jobs.
  * Contributor to [RelengAPI](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Applications/RelengAPI), a platform for building infrastructure services with RESTful APIs and nice self-serve interfaces.
  * Perform ad-hoc investigations and bug fixes (on call).
  * Improved our monitoring and alerting by outfitting existing systems with InfluxDB, Grafana, and PaperTrail.
  * Primary maintainer of "Runner," a specialized init system which forms the foundation of Mozilla's current build infrastructure. Runner has been measured to [save over 72,000 minutes](https://archive.fo/fKuHW) of compute time per day by reducing the setup/teardown time between builds.
  * Primary maintainer of "Clobberer," a service which allows developers to easily flush object caches across large numbers of hosts.
  * Exposed Mozilla's internal build environments to developers via Docker containers.
  * Containerized Linux Firefox Builds.
