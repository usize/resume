Hi there,

I wonder how many cover letters, particularly from software engineers, are written by GPT{N} or some other large language model these days? Surely more than half. It’s efficient so why not? I’d be a little disappointed if it weren’t the case. Which begs the question, am I, Morgan Foster, human being™, really the author of this letter or did I delegate it to a robot? 


Well, it’s really me writing this one at least. And why? If I were job searching in a scattershot fashion (and maybe I will after Meta has another round of layoffs, haha) I’d probably have done that but for now I’m taking advantage of my situation and being a little more selective about which doors I go knocking on and I’m knocking on your door because I think working for the NYT would be .. cool. Interesting. Fun! Because it’s outside of the core tech industry; but I can certainly see how my experience could be useful to you.

If you look at my resume I hope you’ll see that I have a great breadth of experience in the software industry. I have a history of shipping products that people use (JavaScript language features are what I’m most proud of), saving organizations lots of cash (especially at Box) and being a creative and thrifty problem solver. I also have experience with managing big data sets and projects that would fall under the purview of “governance.”

If you take the time to chat with me I hope you’d also notice that I’m a very people oriented person which isn’t always paired with my technical background for better or worse. I like to get to know others and lend a helping hand and this has made me quite effective at cross functional work and generating new projects (or canceling unnecessary projects before they waste everyone’s time). I’ve also acted, and continue to act, as a mentor to the more junior people I work with because I enjoy seeing others succeed.


Which is all to say, I hope you’ll take the time to speak with me. And please excuse the informal approach I’m taking here. I think these days adding a more human touch is worth the loss of decorum. ^_^

Best,

Morgan

PS I’m pasting a robot generated cover letter below for laughs.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Engineer position in the Data Governance and Infrastructure group at The Times. I have extensive experience in building and maintaining secure and scalable infrastructure and APIs, and I am passionate about creating best-in-class data products that enable technical and non-technical users to create pipelines of any complexity.

In my current role at Meta, I shipped a critical multiplayer server allocation and matchmaking service that was falling behind schedule. I achieved this by redesigning its approach to request handling, which improved performance dramatically. At Twitter, as a Team Lead overseeing configuration management, I developed static analysis tools to detect problematic Puppet code and automatically fix it. I also built cross-team relationships that unblocked important projects which had been stalled due to misunderstandings. These experiences gave me a deep understanding of the software development lifecycle and agile engineering practices.

I have 5+ years of experience in Python and object-oriented design, shipping high-quality, and performing systems. My knowledge of distributed systems principles, including consistency and availability, durability, and fault-tolerance, make me a valuable addition to the team. I also have experience with different data storage technologies, including RDBMS, Columnar, NoSQL, and file-based storage solutions.

I am excited about the opportunity to join The Times' Data Governance and Infrastructure group and shape the vision and architecture of the next generation of data transport, collection, and orchestration. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,

Morgan Foster
